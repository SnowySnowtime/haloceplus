A repository for the ever so growing collection of addons available on Garry's Mod by myself. Will include code for server developers to make use of, and information for those lacking understanding of the addon.
Head over to the [Halo CE+ Wiki](https://github.com/SnowySnowtime/haloceplus/wiki) for more information. Additional information will be added over time.
