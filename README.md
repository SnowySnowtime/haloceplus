# haloceplus
A repository for the ever so growing collection of addons available on Garry's Mod by myself. Will include code for server developers to make use of, and information for those lacking understanding of the addon.
Head over to the [Halo CE+ Wiki](https://github.com/SnowySnowtime/haloceplus/wiki) for more information. Additional information will be added over time.

# Info
This repository contains lua for each of the addons I've made that isn't already on github. If you need the actual workshop link, head to the wiki. It has all of the workshop addons in the sidebar, including ``Vuthakral's Draconic Base``, an addon that is required for all of my addons.
